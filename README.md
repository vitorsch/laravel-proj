## About me

I'm a full-stack dev. Got some projects in JS ( with HTML and CSS ) using differents frameworks(VueJs, Angular and ReactJS). Mostly are in my webmoderno-js2020 (others are private), I assume it's kinda mess there. Little by little i'm learning how to organize my files here in Github. Thank you :)
